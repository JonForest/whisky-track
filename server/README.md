## Summary
Small express app to provide a backend for the whisky-track project

To start:
* Ensure working directory is `whisky-track/server`
* Either `yarn install` or `npm install`
* `yarn start` or `npm start`

There is a small delay on the `get` endpoint to demonstrate how react deals with delays in fetching state.

Currently only the `get` and `post` endpoints have been tested.
